# RGB.NET

This project aims to unify the use of various RGB-devices.   
**It is currently under heavy development and will have breaking changes in the future!** Right now a lot of devices aren't working as expected and there are bugs/unfinished features. Please think about that when you consider using the library in this early stage.    
   
If you want to help with layouting/testing devices or if you need support using the library feel free to join the [RGB.NET discord-channel](https://discord.gg/9kytURv).


## Adding prerelease packages using NuGet ##
This is the easiest and therefore preferred way to include RGB.NET in your project.  

Since there aren't any release-packages right now you'll have to use the CI-feed from [http://nuget.arge.be](http://nuget.arge.be).   
You can include it either by adding ```http://nuget.arge.be/v3/index.json``` to your Visual Studio package sources or by adding this [NuGet.Config](https://github.com/DarthAffe/RGB.NET/tree/master/Documentation/NuGet.Config) to your project (at the same level as your solution).
